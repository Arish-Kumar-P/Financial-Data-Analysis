## Financial Data Analysis and Visualization
## Overview
This project performs financial data analysis and visualization using Python and Pandas. It extracts insights from various datasets, such as financial transactions, client information, payments, and subscription details. The analysis includes industry trends, subscription renewal rates, inflation impact, and payment trends over time.


## Features
- **Client Industry Analysis:** Determines the number of clients in different industries.
- **Subscription Renewal Insights:** Analyzes renewal rates across industries.
- **Inflation Impact on Renewals:** Maps inflation rates to renewal periods.
- **Payment Trends:** Identifies median payment trends over years.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses bar charts and pie charts to present insights.

## Data Sources

- `finanical_information.csv` - Contains financial indicators such as inflation rates.
- `industry_client_details.csv` - Client information categorized by industry.
- `payment_information.csv` - Records of payments made by clients.
- `subscription_information.csv` - Subscription start and end dates, including renewal status.
